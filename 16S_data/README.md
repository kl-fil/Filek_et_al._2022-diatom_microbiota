# Processing NGS amplicon sequences for diatom monoculture bacterial communities and their respective source samples (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing)

Sample processing prior to sequencing is described in detail in the Methods section of the FIlek et al. 2022 manuscript. Primers used for sequencing were 515F and 806R (Apprill et al. 2015; Parada et al. 2016).
