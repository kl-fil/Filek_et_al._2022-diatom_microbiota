### IQ-TREE run - full 16S sequences of 40 bacterial isolates
Forty bacterial strains isolated from monoclonal diatom cultures were grown and their 16S rRNA gene was sequenced as described in the manuscript. The sequences (*bacterial_isolates_full_16S.fas*) were aligned with MUSCLE in AliView v1.28 [https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/] (*bacterial_isolates_full_16S_aligned_muscle.fas*) and used for constructing a ML phylogenetic tree with IQ-TREE [http://www.iqtree.org/]. The command and parameters are described in *iqtree_instructions.sh* and the output of `iqtree` is in */iqtree_run_16S_full* folder.  
Full 16S seqeunces were also trimmed to V4 region (515F-806R primers) and shown in file *bacterial_isolates_16S_trimmed_to_V4.fas*; they were used to compare bacterial strain information to 16S NGS data.
