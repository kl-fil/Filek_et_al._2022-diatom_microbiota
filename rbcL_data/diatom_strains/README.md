# Processing *rbcL* sequences of individual diatom strains

## Full *rbcL* sequences ML tree
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showing relative relationships between diatom strains in Filek *et al.* 2022 manuscript was constructed using `IQ-TREE`, visualised in `iTOL`, and further edited in Adobe Illustrator. Files and processing instructions are in */full_rbcl_diatom_strains*. Sequences' accession codes are listed in supplementary material of the manuscript.

## Partial/263 bp barcode *rbcL* sequences ML tree
Full *rbcL* sequences were trimmed to match the NGS sequencing region, added to NGS data (with names modified according to qiime2 taxonomy artefact), and used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree in a similar manner as described above.  
  
All aligning was performed in `AliView v1.28` via `MUSCLE`.
